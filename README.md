Linked List Implementation in Java

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple singly linked list in Java, with additional functionalities such as removing duplicates and reversing the list.

Features

Add Elements: Append elements to the end of the linked list.

Print List: Display the elements of the list in a formatted way.

Remove Duplicates: Remove duplicate elements from the linked list using a HashSet.

Reverse List: Reverse the order of elements in the linked list.

Code Structure

Class: List

Inner Class: Node

Represents a node in the linked list.

Contains:

value: The value stored in the node.

next: A reference to the next node in the list.

Methods:

add(int number): Adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list.

print(): Prints the linked list elements in a readable format.

removeDuplicates(): Removes duplicate values from the list.

reverseList(): Reverses the linked list.

Main Method

The main method demonstrates the usage of the linked list:

Initializes a linked list with an array of integers.

Prints the original list.

Removes duplicate elements and prints the updated list.

Reverses the list and prints the reversed list.
